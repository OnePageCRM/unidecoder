# Unidecoder

This library provides methods to transliterate Unicode characters to an ASCII
approximation.

The functionality in this library was originally written by [Russel Norris](http://github.com/rsl)
for his [Stringex library](http://github.com/rsl/stringex). This gem is an
extraction of the Unicode transliteration functionality from Stringex into a
separate library with some added functionality.

The Unidecoder component of Stringex is itself a port of Sean M. Burke's
[Unidecode](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-Unidecode/lib/Text/Unidecode.pm)
Unidecode Perl module.
